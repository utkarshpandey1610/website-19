        <h1 class="heading">Diet plan and    <span>food dos and don'ts for COVID-19</span>  patients </h1>
        <p>Nutrition plays a significant role for both, the COVID-19 patients and those who are on the path of recovery. During COVID-19, the body gets weakened and it continues for days even after recovering from the symptoms. Thus, it becomes essential to consume the right kind of diet for a speedy and complete recovery of the body. We spoke to celebrity nutritionist Sandhya Gugnani and she recommended some food and diet tips based on the latest research.</p>
        <h2>Recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for Covid patients</h2>
        <p> Start with meeting 50% of the nutritional requirement of the patient and proceed to 70% by the 3rd day, gradually increasing to 100% by the end of the week.</p>
      <h2>Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS) – In case of diarrhoea</h2>
      <p>Around 400-600kcals/day and 30gms of protein should be provided through ONS. This should be continued for at least a month.</p>
      <p>Assessment should be done every 3rd day for patients.</p>
      <h1 class="heading">COVID – Diet <span>(Dos and Don'ts)</span></h1>
      <p>The main diet focus for COVID patients is to consume foods that would help rebuild muscle, immunity and energy levels. Whole grains like ragi, oats or amaranth are rich sources of complex carbohydrates. Chicken, fish, eggs, paneer, soya, nuts and seeds are some good sources of protein. Healthy fats like walnuts, almonds, olive oil, mustard oil are recommended during these days. To boost one’s immunity, one should take turmeric milk once a day.</p>
      <p>Five serving of all coloured fruits and vegetables are a must to get adequate vitamins and minerals when you are COVID positive. You can have small amounts of dark chocolate with at least 70% cocoa which can lift your mood, get rid of anxiety and will also boost your immunit</p>  
      <p>Most COVID patients experience loss of smell and taste or difficulty in swallowing. It is important to eat soft foods at small intervals and to add amchoor in the food.</p>

Therefore, It Is Possible That A Person Could Be Infected With The Virus That Causes COVID-19 Just Before Or Just After Vaccination And Then Get Sick Because The Vaccine Did Not Have Enough Time To Provide Protection.</p><p> Sometimes After Vaccination, The Process Of Building Immunity Can Cause Symptoms, Such As Fever. These Symptoms Are Normal And Are Signs That The Body Is Building Immunity.</p>

        <h1 class="heading">types of     <span>covid -19</span> Vaccines </h1>
        <p>Currently, there are three main types of COVID-19 vaccines that are authorized and recommended or undergoing large-scale (Phase 3) clinical trials in the United States.</p>
        <p>Below is a description of how each type of vaccine prompts our bodies to recognize and protect us from the virus that causes COVID-19. None of these vaccines can give you COVID-19.</p>
        <p> 1- mRNA vaccines contain material from the virus that causes COVID-19 that gives our cells instructions for how to make a harmless protein that is unique to the virus. After our cells make copies of the protein, they destroy the genetic material from the vaccine. Our bodies recognize that the protein should not be there and build T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight the virus that causes COVID-19 if we are infected in the future.</p>
        <p> 2-Protein subunit vaccines include harmless pieces (proteins) of the virus that causes COVID-19 instead of the entire germ. Once vaccinated, our bodies recognize that the protein should not be there and build T-lymphocytes and antibodies that will remember how to fight the virus that causes COVID-19 if we are infected in the future.
        </p>
        <p>3-Vector vaccines contain a modified version of a different virus than the one that causes COVID-19. Inside the shell of the modified virus, there is material from the virus that causes COVID-19. This is called a “viral vector.” Once the viral vector is inside our cells, the genetic material gives cells instructions to make a protein that is unique to the virus that causes COVID-19. Using these instructions, our cells make copies of the protein. This prompts our bodies to build T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus if we are infected in the future.

        <span>how covid-19 spread</span>
        <h3>china </h3>
        <p>The spread of the infection was facilitated by international travel, wrote the researchers. China imposed a lockdown in Wuhan on January 23rd, 2020, when the number of cases was rising. Despite the lockdown and prevention of travel across states or out of the country, over 100 SARS-CoV-2 cases were exported out of China by February 14th, wrote the researchers. As the lockdown came into effect, there was significant prevention of virus export, but still, some cases of undetected community spread continued out of China..</p>
        
       <h3>South Korea, Italy, and Iran</h3>
       <p>By February 2020, a large number of cases were reported in South Korea, Italy, and Iran. There was a rapid local transmission of the infection as well as wider international spread.</p>
       <p>By mid-March, over 80 nations had reported the outbreak, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic on March 11th, 2020. The team wrote, “Assuming that the virus did not arise independently in multiple locations, an outbreak of COVID-19 outside of China requires an infected traveler to bring the virus into the country and subsequently infect others.”</p> 
       <p>This study looked at the rates of export of cases from China, Italy, and Iran, specifically because these nations also recorded the largest outbreaks immediately after the initial outbreak in China. The authors wrote that this would provide “important insight into the spread of the virus through travelers from Wuhan”</p>
    <h3>conclusion</h3>
    <p>The researchers concluded that the exported cases from South Korea were lower than those from China, Italy, and Iran. They call for more careful monitoring and screening of symptomatic travelers with raised public awareness, which can lead to “faster confirmation as well as reduced transmission of COVID-19 pandemic.”</p>
    <p>The researchers wrote in conclusion, “This information and analysis can lead to better epidemiological models, more informed decision making about how travel bans affect the exportation of cases, and how best to surveil and test travelers in order to minimize transmission of COVID-19.”</p>
